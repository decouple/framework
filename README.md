=========
An attempt to create a loosely coupled toolkit for Hack.
Based loosely on Laravel.

## Installation
```composer create-project decouple/framework```
##### OR
```git clone gogs@git.phenocode.com:decouple/framework.git```

## Getting Started
For now check the bootstrap in `bootstrap/http.hh` and `bootstrap/cli.hh`
to get a better idea of how Decouple works.
